This is the react native demo from the React Native DEV Workshop

To start the app on expo run "npx expo start"

Download the expo app from IoS or Android - the app is called Expo Go

You may also need to use the commands: npm install -g yarn yarn add expo If you get this error: ConfigError: Cannot determine which native SDK version your project uses because the module expo is not installed. Please install it with yarn add expo and try again.

Next, scan the qr code that comes up within the expo app
