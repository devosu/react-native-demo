Starting the App with Expo
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to start the app using Expo, a framework and platform for universal React applications.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Download and install it from nodejs.org.
Git: Download and install it from git-scm.com (if you plan to clone a Git repository).
Installation
Install Yarn: Yarn is a package manager that doubles down as project manager. Install it globally by running the following command:

Copy code
npm install -g yarn
Add Expo to Your Project: If you encounter a ConfigError related to the Expo SDK version, you need to add Expo to your project. Run:

csharp
Copy code
yarn add expo
Start the Expo Project: Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:

sql
Copy code
npx expo start
This command will start the Expo CLI server and open a new tab in your default web browser with the Expo developer tools.

Running the App on a Mobile Device
To run the app on your mobile device, follow these steps:

Download the Expo Go App:

For iOS: Search for "Expo Go" on the Apple App Store and install it.
For Android: Search for "Expo Go" on the Google Play Store and install it.
Scan the QR Code:

After running npx expo start, a QR code will appear in the terminal or in the Expo developer tools in your browser.
Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device and scan this QR code.
View Your Project:

After scanning, the app will start building in the Expo Go app on your device. This may take a few moments.
Troubleshooting
Expo SDK Version Error: If you encounter errors related to the Expo SDK version, ensure that Expo is installed in your project directory (yarn add expo).
Network Issues: If your mobile device can't connect to the Expo server, ensure that your device and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.
